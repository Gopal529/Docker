1. To install Docker on an AWS EC2 instance, we’ll enable the “Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7 Extra(RPMs)” yum repository that, by default, is disabled.
$ sudo yum repolist disabled


2.Use the yum-config-manager to enable the repo:
$ sudo yum-config-manager --enable "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7 Extra(RPMs)"

3.Next, you should search for the Docker package and install it. Yum will take care of its dependencies.
$ sudo yum search docker

4.$ sudo yum -y install docker

5.Once the Docker-related packages are installed, you should enable and start the docker service.
$ sudo systemctl enable docker

6.$ sudo systemctl start docker
  $ sudo systemctl status docker
